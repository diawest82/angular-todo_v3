# angular-todo_v3

A fellow student of yours in the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree has just taken the Angular Basics course and has a pretty nice working Angular.js Todo app. They went a little farther and used the ng-resource plugin which allows the application to work automatically using RESTful practices. However, they don’t have experience yet on the server side of things. But you do. Can you help them out?

The ability to provide a back-end for a client-side app is a great skill to have, and you will encounter the need to do this throughout your journey. As long as their app is functioning they will be happy.

I’ve started the shell of the project for you and the app currently serves the Angular app. Remember to use your developer tools in your browser to see what is being attempted.
